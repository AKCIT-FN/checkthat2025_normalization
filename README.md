## Overview

Claim normalization is the process of converting informal social media posts into concise, self-contained, and verifiable statements. 
Training was executed on three platforms: Kaggle kernels equipped with two T4 GPUs, Google Colab Pro sessions with a single T4 GPU, and an on-premise server hosting an A100, which provided training of different models of different sizes.
